Ever since this company installed a new smart register, they have been hacked numerous times. 
Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the new register has been communicating information back to its control server. 
However in order to view the exfiltrated data, some kind of credential is needed. 
Their engineers have listened on the register's network and captured a portion of an email exchange. 
With this information, can you help them find out what kind of information was leaked?
