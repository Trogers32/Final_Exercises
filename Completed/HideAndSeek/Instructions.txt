The only thing that the master-mind criminal, Ralph, has left behind before his passing was this zipped file. 
His final words were 'You now have all you need to find my last flag... the flag that you find will grant you access to my secret hideout'. 
Please Help the investigation team find this flag!

Tried edit as text, adding a layer and showing the difference, tried layering the pictures on top of one another, changing color schemes, 
using strings command, using binwalk(maybe ARJ archive data in 1.jpg), tried steghide extract using the 'code' in the hide and seek file name


password for steghide extract is the individual game consoles
Each picture gives a part of the final password to use
for the hideAndSeek.jpeg file
Text from jpg is a hex encoded string that translates to the flag
