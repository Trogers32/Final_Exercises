Title of website is XorSHA512 - implies a hash is involved

Tried Xor/base64 with the above text
Tried Xor brute force with 2 character key - sorted through by removing the bad characters:

Removed lines below a 10 character length, removed empty lines, scrolled through, nothing found.

Inspect page and find "I don't like having letter 'E' in my flag"

Not sure where to go from here.
