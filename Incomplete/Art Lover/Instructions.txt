Tried entering the flag but it didn't work.
Assuming the flag is encrypted.
Tried steghide extract on the jpg of the mona lisa.
Attempted passwords: 
Vinci, DaVinci, LeonardoDaVinci, Leonardo, Renaissance, Art, Painting, Louvre, Dali, Salvador, SalvadorDali, Gogh, VanGogh, VincentVanGogh, Stegano, Steghide
