Seems like a weird way to load an image, doesn't it? Wonder what else you could load that way.

Inspecting the gif shows a massive base64 encoded source name - saved in separate file
Tried changing target to flag.txt, flag.gif, ctf.txt, ctf.gif, Firefox.txt, Firefox.gif

Pulled lYJEEYAxCGMcIg4HMLAAQ4JggO84JAk2L+ACAgAOw== from the end of the troll gif
This gives gibberish.

Not sure how to proceed from here.
